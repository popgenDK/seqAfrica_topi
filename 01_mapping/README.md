# Mapping and filtering of topi

The following describes the commands used to identify/verify adapters, map, and filter BAMs for one or more batches of samples.

See install/scripts.requirements.txt for exact module versions used.

1. Construction of paleomix bam YAML files
The YAML configuration files for the paleomix bam command are required not only for running the mapping pipeline, but are also used by the adapter identification step to locate PE FASTQ files.

Initial YAML files were generated as follows:

    paleomix bam makefile > project.batch_1.yaml
    python3 scripts/install/tsv_files_to_yaml.py project.batch_1.tsv >> project.batch_1.yaml

    paleomix bam makefile > project.batch_2.yaml
    python3 scripts/install/tsv_files_to_yaml.py project.batch_2.tsv >> project.batch_2.yaml

The YAML files were tweaked to minimize read filtering and trimming of low quality bases.

2. Identification of adapters
To ensure that the correct adapter sequences were trimmed from all samples, AdapterRemoval --identify-adapters was run on all PE reads and the output was compared with the recommended BGI or Illumina adapters sequences for trimming:

Illumina forward: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
Illumina reverse: AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT

BGI forward: AAGTCGGAGGCCAAGCGGTCTTAGGAAGACAA
BGI reverse: AAGTCGGATCGTAGCCATGTCGTTCTGTGAGCCAAGGAGTTG

A makefile is provided for running the scripts for each batch:

    make adapters BATCH=batch_1
    make adapters BATCH=batch_2

Individual output files from AdapterRemoval --identify-adapters are written to ${BATCH}.adapters/ and the resulting ${BATCH}.adapters.tsv files contains attemped automatic classifications of adapter sequences, reporting the best match with either BGI or Illumina sequences.

The following adapters were identified and the AdapterRemoval settings --adapter1 and --adapter2 were updated in the YAML files using those sequences:

Batch 1: Standard Illumina adapters.

3. Read mapping
Read mapping was performed using a development version of PALEOMIX. Minimal filtering is performed during this run (see above), with the final BAM file containing all input reads (some pairs of which may be merged into a single sequence), except for empty reads.

A makefile is provided for running the pipeline for each batch:

    make mapping BATCH=batch_1

The output BAMs, temporary files, and logs are written to ${BATCH}.raw_bams/.

4. Insert size quantiles
Run the SnakeMake file to collect insert size quantiles:

    make insert_sizes BATCH=batch_1
    make insert_sizes BATCH=batch_2

The resulting tables are written to ${BATCH}.insert_sizes.tsv.

5. Filtering and SAMTools statistics
Run the SnakeMake file to filter the BAMs and to collect SAMTools statistics:

    make filtering BATCH=batch_1
    make filtering BATCH=batch_2

This writes the filtered BAMs and statistics files to ${BATCH}/.

6. Coverage statistics
Coverage of filtered and retained reads were gathered following filtering:

    make coverage BATCH=batch_1
    make coverage BATCH=batch_2
   
The resulting tables are written to ${BATCH}.coverage.tsv.
